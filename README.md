## 🧑🏻‍🏫 How to install
1. Create a folder where you want to keep your files.
2. Open the environment you are using. For Visual Studio Code, you can open a terminal (make sure you are in the newly created folder) and type:
```
code .
```
3. Using the terminal again, type:
```
git clone https://github.com/Szym0nion/CV
```
4. I recommend downloading the plugin: <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer">_Live Server_ </a>. This will allow you to see changes in your CV live. If using the Atom environment this is it _atom-live-server_.
## ✅ I allow you to use this template to turn it into your own CV
